# Example Mini-Project:
# THE MYSTICAL OCTOSPHERE! - Andrea Crain

# Type-your-question version

# Before starting this practice mini-project,
# make sure you've done the week 1 version of the
# Mystical Octosphere. In that version, you had to
# enter your questions into the code at the bottom.

# In week 2 of the class, though, we want to allow
# people to enter their question into an input
# box. It will still display the output in the
# console and use all the same logic as last week.

# Believe it or not, we can do this by adding just 
# three lines of code!

# Let's get started!

import random
import simplegui

# You do not need to change the function number_to_fortune
def number_to_fortune(number):
    if number == 0:
        return "Yes, for sure!"
    elif number == 1:
        return "Probably yes."

        return "Seems like yes..."
    elif number == 3:
        return "Definitely not!"
    elif number == 4:
        return "Probably not."
    elif number == 5:
        return "I really doubt it..."
    elif number == 6:

    elif number == 7:
        return "I really can't tell."

        return "Something was wrong with my input."
